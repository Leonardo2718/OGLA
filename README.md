#Open Generic Lexical Analyzer

OGLA is a lexical analysis library for C++.

The main purpose of OGLA is to provide an easy to use lexical analyzer that is not tied to any particular language
grammar.  Its focus is on flexibility and ease of use, as opposed to speed and efficiency.  It's intended for projects
that only require **basic** lexical analysis.  It is **not intended for use in advanced applications** (e.g. a compiler).

Uses for this library:
+ parsing command line agruments
+ parsing custom config files
+ prity printing
